N.B. from memory so not exact ((AKA lapin a la moutarde))

Ingredients:
- rabbit, cut in 6 - 8 pieces
- shallot, minced
- bacon, chopped
- mushrooms, cleaned
- sour cream (or creme fraiche)
- dijon mustard
- butter
- salt, pepper
- olive oil
- wine
- optional: herbs like rosemary or parsley, chopped

Directions:
1. mix a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper [, and rosemary if you like] in with the mustard, rub over the rabbit pieces, put in a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least an hour
2. bring the rabbit out, scrape off the marinade (and retain)
3. cook the bacon and shallot in a pan, transfer to bottom of iron pot.  brown mushrooms and transfer to pot
4. melt butter in the pan, brown the rabbit pieces, and transfer to the iron pot
5. deglaze pan with white wine, add the marinade & stir/whisk.  pour onto the rabbit in the iron pot.
6. bring iron pot to boil, then lower heat and simmer covered until rabbit is cooked (depends on the rabbit size and age - older rabbit will take longer)
7. take out rabbit pieces, whisk in the sour cream or creme fraiche [and parsley if you like], pour over rabbit pieces

Leftover pulled meat can be quite nice tossed with gnocchi or spaetzle.
